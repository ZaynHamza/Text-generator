# Text-generator
An NLP model, a sentences generator from stories or novels as a source to the model using NLTK.

The default source text file is a sample from the Game of Thrones script.

You can experiment with any text script you want, only put the file in the same directory as the code and enter its name in the input (including the file extension).

I recommend to download the file and run it in IDE.

# What I learned:
• Regexp module.

• NLTK

• collection module, defaultdict and Counter.
